# Web3 Essentials

## Bitcoin

- one of the first `protocols` to use the `Blockchain` technology
- [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/) by Satoshi Nakamoto
  - peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network
  - network was powered by cryptography and decentrality
- seen as a superior `digital store` of value or digital gold

## Ethereum

- and other similar Smart Contract platforms take a step further from the Bitcoin platform
- built on the same Blockchain infrastructure with some additional features
- [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) by Vitalik Buterin
- along with decentralized transactions, other features included:
  - decentralized agreements (Smart Contracts)
  - decentralized organizations
- unlike Bitcoin which was viewed only as a store of value, Ethereum was viewed as both store of value and a utility to facilitate these decentralized agreements

## Smart Contracts

- are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary
- first proposed in early 1990s by Nick Szabo
- exist and executed on the decentralized platforms like Ethereum
- is the factor that differentiates Bitcoin from Ethereum
  - Bitcoin does not have Smart Contracts unlike Ethereum
  - Bitcoin is intentionally "turning incomplete"

### Oracle Problem

- to convert everyday agreements to digital agreements on blockchains, they need to access the data
- these Blockchains are intentionally walled off and hence cannot read or listen to data from the real world
- `Blockchain Oracles` solve this problem by interacting with the `off-chain` world to provide external data or computation to Smart Contracts

> A single `Blockchain Oracle` or data source cannot be used as it defeats the purpose of blockchain. Inorder to keep the system fully decentralized, a decentralized `Blockchain Oracle` network is needed.

> `Chainlink` is a modular, decentralized oracle network that can both bring external data and external computation into the Smart ontracts to make the system decentralized end-to-end. It is also blockchain agnostic.

> This `on-chain` decentralized logic along with the `off-chain` decentralized data/computation gives rise to `Hybrid Smart Contracts`.

> Important Keywords
>
> - Dapp - Decentralized Application = Decentralized Protocol = Smart Contract
>   - A decentralized application is usually a combination of many Smart Contracts

### Purpose of Blockchain or Smart Contracts

- [McDonald's scandal](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-mcdonalds-story.html)
- relandscape markets and agreements
- makes the agreements unbreakable promises as Smart Contracts are
  - immutable and cannot be altered once deployed
  - decentralized and not limited to a single authority
  - transparent and everyone sees the terms of the agreement
  - impossible to hack, defraud or manipulate
  - executed automatically
- `Smart Contract Value = Trust Minimized Agreements`
  - Moving over from `Brand-based` to `Math-based` agreements

> **Note:**
>
> Any agreement in the history of mankind where there was a trust assumption that was broken, Smart Contracts can and should be applied to.

## Other Blockchain Benefits

- Decentralized
- Transparency & Flexibility
- Speed & Efficiency
- Security & Immutability
- Counterparty Risk Removal
- Trust Minimized Agreements

## Smart Contract based Industries

- **DeFi**

  - Decentralized Finance
  - gives users the ability to engage with finance and markets in a decentralized way

- **DAOs**

  - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
  - are groups that are governed completely decentralized by a set of Smart Contracts on-chain
    - fair and transparent governance & voting

- **NFT**
  - Non-Fungible Tokens
  - digital arts or unique assets

> Note:
>
> - Access to `secret phrase` gives access to all accounts on a wallet
> - Access to a `private key` gives access to a single account
